# Batsumi

This is my first project in kotlin and it is part of my MTN App Academy project.
The objective of the app is to create a digital market place for all people who are excluded by the current system.
Batsumi App is a link between businesses in the african townships, "last mile" delivery services for "kasi" products.
My intention is to publish this app to Play Store.
